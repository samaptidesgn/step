	<h1><b>The Michigan</b></h1>
	<p>On April the Territory of Michigan passed a new act changing materially the appearance, and slightly the nature of the existing educational organization. A board of trustees was appointed to oversee the corporation; the positions of president and vice president were eliminated, and Monteith and Richard were appointed to the board. The University of Michigan took the place of the Catholcpistemiad Michigania as the legal name of the corporation.</p>
	<section>
		<p>The years 1837-1850 disclosed serious weakness in the organization and working of the university. Regents of the university discovered that the organic act from which they derived their powers, made them too dependent upon the legislature. The subject was brought to the attention of the legislature more than once but without securing the desired action in order to achieve increased independence.
